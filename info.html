    <h2>Historic Town LE GILOTINE</h2>
    <p>Halifax was a thriving cloth-producing town, and the device was introduced to protect its economy.

    <h2>The Execution Process</h2>
      <p>The Gibbet‚Äôs mechanism was straightforward:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A wooden platform held the condemned prisoner.</li>
      <li>A block of wood with an embedded iron axe blade was hoisted to the top.</li>
      <li>The block was released by cutting a rope or pulling a pin, dropping the blade to deliver a swift beheading.</li>
      <li>The design ensured a quick execution, minimizing suffering.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Executions were public events, often drawing large crowds.</p>
    <h3>The efficiency and spectacle of the Gibbet made it both feared and notorious across the region.</h3>

    <h2>The Power of justice and the LAW and Blade</h2>
    <p>The gibbet blade, or axe, weighed 7lb 12oz [3.2Kg] and was attached to a block of wood suspended by a piece of rope from the top of the gibbet. This would deliver a crushing blow to the neck. The rope would be attached to a pin at the side of the gibbet platform; it is said that in the case of a cloth theft the rope would be passed among the crowd, while in the case of stock theft, the rope would be attached to the stolen animal, whatever it was. Other methods was the use of a horse - once the horse was instructed to move the blade fell, cutting swiftly through the neck.</p>

    <h2>Public outrage: opposition of gibbet</h2>
    <p>It is impossible to determine with any accuracy how many individuals were executed using the Halifax Gibbet. By 1650, public opinion deemed beheading an excessively severe punishment for petty theft. Consequently, Oliver Cromwell, Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England, forbade the use of the gibbet, and the structure was subsequently dismantled.</p>
